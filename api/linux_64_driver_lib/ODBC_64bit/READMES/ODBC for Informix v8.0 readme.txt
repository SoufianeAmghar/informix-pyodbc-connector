    Requirements

* The installer program requires a JVM that is Java SE 11 or higher, including
  Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, and IBM SDK (Java) distributions.
    

    Installation Directory 

* The default installation directory for the 32-bit driver is:

  /opt/Progress/DataDirect/ODBC

* The default installation directory for the 64-bit driver is:

  /opt/Progress/DataDirect/ODBC

  
    Data Source and Platform Support

For the latest data source and platform support information, refer to the 
Product Compatibility Guide: 
https://docs.progress.com/bundle/datadirect-product-compatibility/resource/
datadirect-product-compatibility.pdf 
  
  
    Changes Since 8.0.2 GA

JRE Requirement for the Installer
---------------------------------
The installer program now requires you to install a JRE that is Java SE 11 or
higher before running the installer. In earlier versions, the JRE used by the
installer program was included in the product. However, to avoid potential
security vulnerabilities, the installer program no longer includes a JRE.
Instead, the installer program uses the JRE in your environment to allow for
the most secure version of a JRE to be used.
 
Notes:
* This change does not affect the JVM requirements for the driver. For the latest 
  driver requirements, refer to the Product Compatibility Guide:
  https://docs.progress.com/bundle/datadirect-product-compatibility/resource/
  datadirect-product-compatibility.pdf
* The installer program cannot remove the already installed JRE files from the 
  install directory automatically. Remove them manually.

ICU Library Upgrade (74.1) for AIX Platforms
--------------------------------------------
For AIX platforms, the ICU library files that are installed with the
product have been upgraded to version 74.1. As a part of this upgrade, 
the ICU library file names have changed for AIX platforms:
* For the 32-bit driver: From libivicu28.a to libivicu.a
* For the 64-bit driver: From libddicu28.a to libddicu.a 

Notes:
* This upgrade does not apply to the other UNIX platforms.
* This upgrade is available starting in build 08.02.1072 of the ICU 
  library files.

ICU Library Upgrade (74.1) for Linux Platforms
----------------------------------------------
For Linux platforms, the ICU library files that are installed with the
product have been upgraded to version 74.1. As a part of this upgrade, 
the ICU library file names have changed for Linux platforms: 
* For the 32-bit driver: From libivicu28.so to libivicu.so
* For the 64-bit driver: From libddicu28.so to libddicu.so

Note:
* This upgrade does not apply to UNIX platforms.
* This upgrade is available starting in build 08.02.0965 of the ICU 
  library files.

ODBC Cursor Library
-------------------
The product package no longer includes the ODBC Cursor library file 
(odbccurs.so) because it has some known security vulnerabilities that 
could potentially expose you to security risks.

Note: The installer program cannot remove the ODBC Cursor library file 
automatically while installing a new version of the driver. Remove it 
manually.

Changes to Installation of Non-Essential Components 
-----------------------------------------------------
The installer program has been updated to no longer install common components 
for drivers that do not use them. As a result, the installer program no longer 
installs the following common components for the Informix Wire Protocol
driver: 

* OpenSSL library files, such as ivopenssl30.so, ddopenssl30.so, fips.so, 
  and openssl.cnf.
* Curl library files, such as libivcurl28.so and libddcurl28.so. 

If the files are not used by any other DataDirect driver on your machine, you 
can safely remove them from existing product directories.
	
    
    Release 8.0.2 Features

Enhancements
------------
* The driver has been enhanced to include timestamp in the internal packet 
  logs by default. If you want to disable the timestamp logging in packet 
  logs, set PacketLoggingOptions=1. The internal packet logging is not 
  enabled by default. To enable it, set EnablePacketLogging=1.

* The Driver Manager for UNIX/Linux has been enhanced to support setting the 
  Unicode encoding type for applications on a per connection basis. By passing 
  a value for the SQL_ATTR_APP_UNICODE_TYPE attribute using SQLSetConnectAttr, 
  your application can specify the encoding at connection. This allows your 
  application to pass both UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded strings with a single 
  environment handle. The valid values for the SQL_ATTR_APP_UNICODE_TYPE 
  attribute are SQL_DD_CP_UTF8 and SQL_DD_CP_UTF16. The default value is 
  SQL_DD_CP_UTF8.

* A Password Encryption Tool, called ddencpwd, is now included with the
  product package. It encrypts passwords for secure handling in connection
  strings and odbc.ini files. At connection, the driver decrypts these
  passwords and passes them to the data source as required. Refer to the
  user's guide for details.

Changed Behavior
----------------
* Support has been deprecated for the following versions of Informix:
  - Informix 11.0 and higher
  - Informix 10.0 and higher
  - Informix 9.2 and higher

 
    Configuring Data Sources

Data sources are stored in the system information file (typically, 
odbc.ini). For details on configuring this file, see the PROGRESS DATADIRECT
FOR ODBC FOR INFORMIX WIRE PROTOCOL DRIVER USER'S GUIDE.
 
 
    Driver WorkAround Options

Progress DataDirect has included non-standard connection options (workarounds)
for the driver that enable you to take full advantage of packaged ODBC-enabled
applications requiring non-standard or extended behavior. Refer to the chapter
"WorkAround options" in THE PROGRESS DATADIRECT FOR ODBC DRIVERS REFERENCE for a
description of these options.


     Notes, Known Issues, and Restrictions

Specifying values for the same connection option multiple times
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
The driver does not support specifying values for the same connection 
option multiple times in a connection string or DSN. If a value is 
specified using the same attribute multiple times or using both 
long and short attributes, the connection may fail or the driver may 
not behave as intended.

ODBC Development on UNIX and Linux Platforms
--------------------------------------------
All of the Release 8.0 Core Components (header files, etc.) needed for 
development of ODBC applications on UNIX and Linux are installed into 
the /include directory created by the product installer.

Please read the notices.txt file in the installation directory for 
licensing information regarding the ODBC Core Components. Contact your 
Progress DataDirect representative if you have any questions.

Developers using programming languages other than C++:
The DataDirect ODBC Driver Manager is a C++ shared library. The ODBC 
Driver Manager can be used with any language that supports loading a 
C++ shared library; however, if you are using a programming language 
other than C++, you must take additional steps to ensure that the C++ 
libraries are initialized properly when loaded. If you are not using 
C++, consult your compiler documentation for instructions on using C++ 
shared libraries with your application.

LANG Environment Setting on UNIX and Linux Platforms
----------------------------------------------------
A default installation of the product on UNIX and Linux assumes that 
the value of the LANG environment setting is en_US. If your locale is 
not set to en_US, the drivers may not return error messages properly. 
In this case, you must create a symbolic link in the 
<Install_Dir>/locale directory that has the same value as the LANG 
environment setting. This link must point to the 
<Install_Dir>/locale/en_US directory.

SQLColAttribute(s)
------------------
The column attributes 1001 and 1002, which were assigned as DataDirect- 
specific attributes, were inadvertently used as system attributes by
the Microsoft 3.0 ODBC implementation. Applications using those 
attributes must now use 1901 and 1902, respectively.
 
SQL_C_NUMERIC
-------------
Because of inconsistencies in the ODBC specification, users attempting 
to use SQL_C_NUMERIC parameters must set the precision and scale values 
of the corresponding structure and the descriptor fields in the 
Application Parameter Descriptor.
 
For Developers Using IIS
------------------------
One of the most common connectivity issues encountered while using IIS 
(Microsoft's Internet Information Server) concerns the use and settings 
of the account permissions. If you encounter problems using DataDirect 
drivers with an IIS server, refer to KnowledgeBase document number 4274 
on the Progress DataDirect web site:

http://knowledgebase.datadirect.com.
